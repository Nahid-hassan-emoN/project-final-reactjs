              </h4>
              All prices are listed in Bangladeshi Taka (BDT) and are inclusive
              of VAT and are listed on the Site by the seller that is selling
              the product or service. Items in your Shopping Cart will always
              reflect the most recent price displayed on the item's product
              detail page. Please note that this price may differ from the price
              shown for the item when you first placed it in your cart. Placing
              an item in your cart does not reserve the price shown at that
              time. It is also possible that an item's price may decrease
              between the time you place it in your basket and the time you
              purchase it.
              <br />
              <br />
              We do not offer price matching for any items sold by any seller on
              our Site or other websites.
              <br />
              <br />
              We are determined to provide the most accurate pricing information
              on the Site to our users; however, errors may still occur, such as
              cases when the price of an item is not displayed correctly on the
              Site. As such, we reserve the right to refuse or cancel any order.
              In the event that an item is mispriced, we may, at our own
              discretion, either contact you for instructions or cancel your
              order and notify you of such cancellation. We shall have the right
              to refuse or cancel any such orders whether or not the order has
              been confirmed and your prepayment processed. If such a
              cancellation occurs on your prepaid order, our policies for refund
              will apply. Please note that *** posses 100% right on the refund
              amount. Usually refund amount is calculated based on the customer
              paid price after deducting any sort of discount and shipping fee.
